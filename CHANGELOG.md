# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Album links from Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer, and TIDAL now work in batch files and
  the album command: the release's artist and album title are read from the public page
  (no login) and searched on Qobuz/Amazon, the same way playlist tracks already are.
  Apple links fall back to a brief headless browser read when the static page is
  missing its metadata.
- Apple album links drop Apple's "- Single"/"- EP"/"- Album" decoration and square
  bracket groups like "[feat. ...]" before searching, since both tend to hide the
  release from the download services' search.

### Fixed
- Lucida's embedded page data is now recovered when it arrives with stray characters
  after the JSON object, which intermittently aborted album downloads after a
  successful search ("parse page data: Expected b'JSON5Value' ...").
- Downloaded tracks carrying a composite embedded track number (`6/12`) now have it
  rewritten to the bare number (`6`) after placement, so players and devices show a
  clean position. Already-bare numbers are left untouched.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added
- Public YouTube and YouTube Music playlists now use the complete browser-rendered
  list, including lazy-loaded pages, with the more precise YouTube Music artist data
  when that URL is supplied.
- Public Amazon Music, TIDAL, SoundCloud, and Qobuz playlists now use the same ordered
  extraction, preview, match-checking, correction, download, and resume flow as Apple
  Music, Spotify, and Deezer.

### Changed
- Long TIDAL playlists automatically move beyond the public player's first 50 items;
  large Amazon, Qobuz, SoundCloud, and YouTube playlists are checked against their
  declared size so a known partial list is never accepted silently.
- Playlist help and the interactive menu now present one service-neutral entry point
  for all supported public streaming links.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-09-03

### Fixed
- Spotify playlists longer than 100 items now switch to the complete public web view and
  read every position instead of stopping at the public player's initial window.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added
- Public Spotify playlists can now use the complete `playlist`, `--dry-run`, `--check`,
  correction, download, and resume workflow without a Spotify login or API key.
- Public Deezer playlists use the same workflow, including pagination for large lists.

### Changed
- Playlist source detection is automatic from the pasted URL. The CLI and TUI now offer
  one streaming-playlist entry point for Apple Music, Spotify, and Deezer.
- Spotify imports detect the public player's 100-item window and refuse a known partial
  import, directing the user to `playlist-file` instead of silently losing tracks.
- Spotify podcast episodes are ignored because lucidadl's matching and download flow is
  intentionally music-only.
- Automatic matching now rejects clearly labelled alternate versions and cover results
  where the requested performer is only a secondary credit.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added
- `lucida playlist URL --check` resolves every Apple Music title through the normal
  Qobuz/Amazon matching path without downloading, and clearly lists unresolved entries.
- `lucida playlist-file FILE --name "My playlist"` turns a reviewed or edited text list
  into the same ordered playlist folder and portable `.m3u8` output.
- `lucida cleanup` removes stale download-state references and `.part` files older than
  24 hours without touching completed audio.

### Changed
- Interrupted playlist downloads now retain their source order, destination, settings,
  and collection name. `lucida retry` resumes the complete saved run while skipping files
  already present; ordinary playlist failures retry directly into the original playlist
  at their original track numbers.
- Apple Music extraction now uses stable semantic page attributes alongside the existing
  visual-list reader, with a structured-data fallback and clearer private, missing, and
  region-unavailable diagnostics.
- Duplicate occurrences of the same song are preserved as distinct playlist positions.
  Existing 1.1 playlist files are recognized and migrated lazily without re-downloading.
- Playlist `.m3u8` files are written atomically and sort track numbers numerically even
  when an updated playlist changes its zero-padding width.
- Temporary network and server errors use bounded retries and `Retry-After`; permanent
  request failures stop sooner, incomplete response bodies never become finished files,
  and common failures now include a useful next step.
- Extracted Apple Music lists are saved under the application data directory rather than
  silently overwriting `inputs/playlist.txt` in the current working directory.
- The interactive playlist flow now offers download/resume, match checking, extraction,
  and reviewed text-list import as explicit choices.
- `lucida doctor` verifies that the music folder is writable and reports stale partial
  files or an interrupted playlist waiting to be resumed.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added
- Downloading a playlist now writes an `.m3u8` sidecar inside `Playlists/<name>/`,
  listing its tracks in order. Music players and hardware devices (Garmin watches, car
  units, phones) only show a real *playlist* when such a file is present — a bare folder
  of tracks isn't one. Entries are relative filenames, so the folder stays portable.
- `lucida doctor --live` explicitly runs the browser and network check when needed.

### Changed
- The interactive menu groups everyday downloads and maintenance tools into clearer
  sections, with a guided first-run setup and visible access status.
- `lucida setup` now installs the matching Playwright Chromium build when it is missing,
  so the recommended pipx installation no longer needs a separate Playwright command.
- `lucida doctor` is now a quick local check by default and never opens a browser unless
  `--live` is supplied.
- Failed albums and tracks keep their original type, so `lucida retry` no longer retries
  an album as if it were a song. Download commands also return a failing exit status when
  work remains, which makes scheduled runs reliable.
- Missing matches and failed requested transcodes are now reported as failures rather
  than successful skips/downloads; the original audio is kept if conversion fails.
- Automatic `artist - title` matching rejects weak or ambiguous results instead of
  silently downloading a likely-wrong song.
- Playlist import now clearly supports Apple Music only; unused, unvalidated stubs for
  other services were removed.
- The former “watchlists” are now presented for what they are: one-off batch downloads
  from any `.txt` file. The TUI asks for a file and never edits it; the existing
  `lucida tracks` and `lucida albums` commands remain compatible.
- The TUI now ends downloads with a compact success/skip/failure summary. Missing batch
  files and interactive-search failures also return useful messages and non-zero exit
  statuses, while cancelling a search remains successful.
- Developer diagnostics remain available but no longer clutter the main command list.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-28

First stable release. Feature-complete and validated end to end; no code changes since
0.1.1 — promoted to 1.0 and marked Production/Stable.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-28

### Added
- Playlist tracks are numbered (`NN - Title`) so they keep the playlist order in their
  flat folder instead of sorting alphabetically.

### Changed
- Filenames drop the redundant artist prefix (just `Title.ext`), since tracks are already
  organized under `Artists/<Artist>/<Album>/`.
- Cleaner playlist output: a table for `--dry-run` and a single header line + progress
  bars for a download, instead of dumping the whole tracklist and a per-track log line.

### Fixed
- Find niche and multi-artist tracks. When a literal `"Artist - Title"` query returns
  nothing, retry with the title alone (and a primary-artist + title form), verifying the
  artist before accepting — so a broadened search can't silently grab the wrong song.
- Playlist dedup is scoped to the playlist folder: a track already in `Artists/` (or
  another playlist) is still fetched into a playlist that's missing it, without
  re-downloading copies already there.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-27

First public release.

### Added
- **Fast parallel downloads** over HTTP (`-j/--jobs`) — the Cloudflare challenge is
  solved once in a real browser (`setup`), the `cf_clearance` cookie is cached, and
  everything else runs over `httpx`, so no browser stays open.
- **Search or URL** for `track` / `album` (singular, ad-hoc) and `tracks` / `albums`
  (watchlists with dedup), plus automatic **service fallback** (Qobuz → Amazon).
- **Albums downloaded track-by-track** in parallel.
- **Local transcoding** with bundled ffmpeg (`--to`, `--bitrate`); tags and cover art
  preserved. `-F/--format` requests a server-side format from lucida.
- **Tag-based organization** into `Artists/<Artist>/<Album>/`, with an API-metadata
  fallback when a file has no embedded tags. Playlists go under `Playlists/<name>/`.
- **Apple Music playlist import** (`playlist`) — the tracklist is scraped headless, with
  a visible-window fallback, then each track is downloaded via Qobuz.
- **Interactive menu** (`lucida ui`, or bare `lucida`) and **live progress bars** (one
  per parallel download).
- **Interactive search** (`search`), **retry** of failures (`retry`), and a `config`
  command for the fixed music directory.
- **Existence-aware dedup**: an item is skipped only while its file still exists; delete
  it and it is re-downloaded. `--force` ignores the dedup memory.
- **Fixed, configurable download directory** (`~/Downloads/music` by default;
  `lucida config --music`, or the `LUCIDADL_MUSIC` env var).
